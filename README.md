# Project: SelfDrivingCar

### Introduction
This project uses deep neural networks to learn how to drive a car.
A car can go forward, backward, left and right. The goal is to teach the car to drive itself amongst the traffic.
We simulate traffic by placing other cars on the road. The car will learn to avoid collisions with other cars and stay on the road.
